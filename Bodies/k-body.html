    <h1>Frida Kahlo</h1>

    <p>For many years after her death, Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was kept in the shadows, known simply as the wife of Diego Rivera, the celebrated Mexican artist. Slowly, her posthumous fame eclipsed his, making her arguably the world's most famous female artist, and her sexuality and left field approach to gender, class and race finally revealed itself. Born in Mexico City, Kahlo contracted polio as a child, and survived a bus crash in her teens that left her with bouts of intense pain and difficult surgeries for the rest of her life. Kahlo had an infamously volatile marriage with Rivera, but also navigated relationships with a number of women, including Josephine Baker. But her queer hero status is based on more than just flings with women; it comes from Kahlo's incredible female sexual confidence, often dragging up in men's clothing. Her angry rejection of normative behaviour was completely at odds with 1930's, 40's and 50's macho society.</p>

    <h1>Larry Kramer</h1>

    <p>In 1980's New York, award winning gay writer and playwright Larry Kramer (1935-present) helped co-found Gay Men's Health Crisis in order the combat the affects of the AIDs epidemic. From the start, the actions of GMHC didn't satisfy Kramer's furious anger at attitudes towards the growing AIDs crisis. It was an organisation which raised funds and helped with social care for gay men with HIV and AIDs, but Kramer wanted to go further, targeting the NYC mayor for funds, threatening closeted gay bureaucrats who failed to help, and penning <em>1,112 and Counting...</em> (1983), a scathing article designed to scare men out of their apathy towards the disease. Kramer's subsequent ejection from GMHC is documented in his autobiographical and acclaimed play <em>The Normal Heart</em> (1985). In 1987, Kramer's longing for a politically motivated group helped form Act Up, the AIDs Coalition to Unleash Power. They targeted government organisations and megacorps with direct action to publicise the lack of funds and treatment for people with HIV and AIDs, and inspired hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe. Today, Kramer's Act Up is still fighting the good fight, and GMHC is a world leader in HIV prevention.</p>
