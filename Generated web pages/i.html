<h1>Christopher Isherwood</h1>

<p>Christopher Isherwood (1904-1986) was the author of <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> (1939) and <em>A Single Man</em> (1964). As a teenager, he churned out stories and poems, created a literary fantasy world with is friend Edward Upward, and wrote plays with WH Auden. Asked to leave Cambridge University after deliberately ruining his exam paper, Isherwood spent a brief spell studying medicine before heading off to Weimar, Berlin. Years later, in <em>Christopher and His Kind</em> (1976), Isherwood revealed the story of a contemporary and sexually accomplished queer hero. <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> was reworked by John Van Druten for the stage play <em>I Am a Camera</em> (1951), which was later adapted into the hugely successful musical <em>Cabaret</em> (1966). Isherwood's fame grew, but by 1953, he had other things on his mind and fell in love with 18 year old college student, Don Bachardy. After a tricky patch that inspired Isherwood's <em>A Single Man</em>, one of his finest works, the pair stayed together until Isherwood's death in 1986.</p>
